    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
    <p class="indented">
      Welcome to E-101. A website that teaches students how to study.
      In this website, I will be providing users a few methods and
      tricks & tips on how to effectively and efficiently study.

      <h2>Absorbing Information</h2>
      <p>
        The first skill one must know is how to even take in the
        information he/she is receiving. The most famous and
        recommended method is <b>Active Recall</b>. <br /><br />
        This method includes listening to your teacher for a few
        seconds and writing a summary of what he/she said. As an
        example I will use two students: John and Bob.
        <br /><br />
        John uses the active recall method and summarizes the
        information given by
        <b>keeping what's important</b> and the other non-important
        information he doesn't use. This boosts his productivity
        rate by alot and allows him to study faster while still
        scoring good grades.
        <br />
        Unlike John, Bob doesn't use active recall. Instead he just
        writes down all his information and attempts to study after.
        Due to the amount of information he wrote down, he has a
        hard time studying and often either loses all that he
        studied in no time, or end up feeling really stressed and
        overloaded, or sometimes even both.

      <h2>Note-Taking Methods</h2>
      <p>
        The second skill you can learn is how to document the
        summarized information. There are many ways but I shall
        provide you with my top 3 note taking methods. They include
        <b>Cornell Method</b>, <b>Charting Method</b>, and
        <b>Outline Method</b>. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>Cornell Method</h3>
      <p>
        This method includes having a section for main notes, a
        section for key tips / questions and a section for a summary
        of the main notes. It is a broad and versatile method
        capable of being used in nearly all subjects.

      </details> -->
      </p>

      <h3>Charting Method</h3>
      <p>
        The Charting Method is a table-like structure to document
        notes categorized into topics. For each topic you have a
        description, observation and sometimes even a pros and cons
        section. The description serves as a box to store the notes
        of that topic while the observation serves as a box to store
        summarized notes or, as the name says, observations. The
        pros and cons tells the goods and bads about a specific
        topic. This method can be used in many subjects but is
        mainly used in
        <abbr title="Biology, Chemistry, and Physics">The Sciences</abbr>.

      </details> -->
      </p>
      <h3>Outline Method</h3>
      <p>
        The outline method includes making a topic and placing the
        subtopic under, then placing notes about that subtopic under
        the subtopic in a neat, indented format. It can be used in
        almost all subjects and is very useful and effective.

      <h2>Studying The Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we finished how to summarize the notes and how to note down tha summarized info, we shall go over how
        to study the notes. Actually studying the notes is the hard part but if yoi follow these tips it will be <em>as
          easy as saying ABC</em>.

      <dl>
        <dt>Tip 1- <b>Repitition</b>:</dt>
        <dd>Repitition is essential - as a matter of fact, it is the key to studying. Repitition involves repeating
          something over and over again 'til it's stuck in your brain. eg:
          <ul class="note">
            <li style="font-style: italic;">You can repeat the formula <b>E = mc²</b> over and over again until it's
              stuck in your head.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt>Tip 2- <b>Make a Study Timetable</b>:</dt>
        <dd>A study timetable is essential in studying as you can manage the times you study with ease. It is
          recommended that in your study timetable you have:

          <ul class="indented">
            <li><b>All your subjects</b></li>
            <li><b>Around 20 - 45 minutes of studying.</b></li>
            <li><b>Break Time</b></li>
          </ul>
          Eg: <br><br>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <caption>My Study Timetable</caption>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>Monday</th>
          <th>Tuesday</th>
          <th>Wednesday</th>
          <th>Thursday</th>
          <th>Friday</th>
          <th>Saturday</th>
          <th>Sunday</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="1">Maths</td>
          <td>Biology</td>
          <td>Music</td>
          <td>R.E</td>
          <td>P.E</td>
          <td rowspan="3">FREE</td>
          <td rowspan="3">FREE</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="1">Physics</td>
          <td>Chemistry</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Info. Tech</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Business</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Spanish</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="1">Business</td>
          <td>Geography</td>
        </tr>


      </table> <br>

      <dl>
        <dt>Tip 3- <b>Use Flashcards</b></dt>
        <dd>For our very last tip I recommend flashcards. Flashcards are a great help when it comes to studying as they
          require you to peak in your brain for the answer to the question. You can make flashcards <abbr
            title="In Real Life">irl</abbr> by taking a piece of paper or coloured paper and writing a question on one
          side and the answer on the other. You can also do it online through apps such as:
          <ul class="indented">
            <li><b>Quizlet</b></li>
            <li><b>Gizmo</b></li>
            <li><b>Flashcard Maker</b></li>
          </ul>
